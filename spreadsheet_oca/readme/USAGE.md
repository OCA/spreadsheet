## **Edit the columns of a list**

- Open the list side panel (`Data` menu, then the list name).
- In the `Columns` section you can remove or reorder the columns, and add
  new ones with the field selector. Relational fields can be followed to
  add related values, e.g. `Company > Name` (`company_id.name`).
- Click on `Insert list` to write the updated columns in the sheet.

## **Group a pivot by related fields**

- Open the pivot side panel and click on `Add` in the `Columns` or `Rows`
  section.
- Click on the arrow next to a many2one field to see the fields of the
  related model, then pick one, e.g. `Company > Fiscal Country`.
- Only stored fields can be used, as the grouping is done in the database.
