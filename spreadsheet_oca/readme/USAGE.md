  >   for the specified account(s) and period.

  >   fiscal year encompassing the provided date.
  > - `ODOO.FISCALYEAR.END(day)`: Returns the ending date of the fiscal
  >   year encompassing the provided date.
  > - `ODOO.ACCOUNT.GROUP(type)`: Returns the account ids of a given
  >   group where type should be a value of the `account_type` field of
  >   `account.account` model. (`income`, `asset_receivable`, etc.)

## **Try what-if changes without touching the original**

Go to 'Spreadsheet \> Configuration \> What-If Scenarios' to model an
alternative set of numbers against an existing spreadsheet.

- Pick the **Base Spreadsheet** and give the scenario a name.
- **Cell Overrides** is a JSON object of cell reference to value, for example
  `{"B3": 125000, "Dashboard!C2": 38}`. Prefix with a sheet name when the
  workbook has more than one. Invalid JSON or a malformed cell reference is
  rejected when you save, not when you run it.
- **Apply to Copy** creates a *new* spreadsheet with the overrides written in.
  The original is never modified, so you can compare the two side by side or
  keep several scenarios against the same baseline.
