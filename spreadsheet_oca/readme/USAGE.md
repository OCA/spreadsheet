  > - `ODOO.DEBIT(account_codes, date_range)`: Get the total debit for
  >   the specified account(s) and period.
  > - `ODOO.BALANCE(account_codes, date_range)`: Get the total balance
  >   for the specified account(s) and period.
  > - `ODOO.FISCALYEAR.START(day)`: Returns the starting date of the
  >   fiscal year encompassing the provided date.
  > - `ODOO.FISCALYEAR.END(day)`: Returns the ending date of the fiscal
  >   year encompassing the provided date.
  > - `ODOO.ACCOUNT.GROUP(type)`: Returns the account ids of a given
  >   group where type should be a value of the `account_type` field of
  >   `account.account` model. (`income`, `asset_receivable`, etc.)

## **Write spreadsheet edits back to Odoo records**

Tick **Writeback Enabled** on a spreadsheet to let edits made in a List cell
update the underlying Odoo record.

Every write is checked against the editing user's own access rights — the
spreadsheet must be readable by them, and the target record writable — and each
change is recorded in **Writeback Logs** with the previous value, so it can be
rolled back from the log's **Roll Back** button.

Only simple value fields can be written back: text, numbers, dates, booleans
and selections. Relational fields (Many2one, tags, attachments) are rejected,
because the previous value is stored as text and a related record cannot be
restored from its text form.
