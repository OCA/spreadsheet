This module adds a functionality for adding and editing Spreadsheets using Odoo CE.

It is an alternative to the proprietary module ``spreadsheet_edition`` of Odoo Enterprise Edition.

Usage
=====

**Create a new spreadsheet**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Go to 'Spreadsheet' menu
* Click on 'Create'
* Put a name, then click on the "Edit" button

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/spreadsheet/16.0/spreadsheet_oca/static/description/spreadsheet_create.png

* At this point you switch to spreadsheet editing mode.
  The editor is named ``o-spreadsheet`` and looks like another common spreadsheet web editors.
  (OnlyOffice, Ethercalc, Google Sheets (non-free)).

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/spreadsheet/16.0/spreadsheet_oca/static/description/spreadsheet_edit.png

* You can use common functions ``SUM()``, ``AVERAGE()``, etc. in the cells.
  For a complete list of functions and their syntax,
  Refer to the documentation https://github.com/odoo/o-spreadsheet/
  or go to https://odoo.github.io/o-spreadsheet/ and click on "Insert > Function".

* Note: Business Odoo module can add "business functions".
  This is currently the case for the accounting module, which adds the following features:

    * ``ODOO.CREDIT(account_codes, date_range)``: Get the total credit for the specified account(s) and period.
    * ``ODOO.DEBIT(account_codes, date_range)``: Get the total debit for the specified account(s) and period.
    * ``ODOO.BALANCE(account_codes, date_range)``: Get the total balance for the specified account(s) and period.
    * ``ODOO.FISCALYEAR.START(day)``: Returns the starting date of the fiscal year encompassing the provided date.
    * ``ODOO.FISCALYEAR.END(day)``: Returns the ending date of the fiscal year encompassing the provided date.
    * ``ODOO.ACCOUNT.GROUP(type)``: Returns the account ids of a given group where type should be a value of the ``account_type`` field of ``account.account`` model.
      (``income``, ``asset_receivable``, etc.)

**Create a new dynamic spreadsheet from pivot**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Go to any pivot
* Press on insert button
* Select the dynamic rows or dynamic columns option and set a number of rows/columns

A new table that will be updated with the actual or filtered values will be added.

* Note: When a pivot has multiple levels of aggrupations in the rows or the columns, 
  the number of rows/columns selected will be transfered to each level.

  Example:
  number of groups -> 2
  number of rows -> 3
  
  * val1
    * subval1.1
    * subval1.2
    * subval1.3
  * val2
    * subval2.1
    * subval2.2
    * subval2.3
  * val3
    * subval3.1
    * subval3.2
    * subval3.3
  
Here is a visual exaple of use:

Development
===========

If you want to develop custom business functions, you can add others, based on the file
https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/16.0/addons/spreadsheet_account/static/src/accounting_functions.js

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Adding new lines on pivot tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we add a pivot table, the number of rows is predefined according to the current data.

In order to add new rows, we need to reinsert the pivot table.
